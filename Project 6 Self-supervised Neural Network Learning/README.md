### Project 6: Self-supervised Neural Network Learning

#### **1. Project Overview**

This project investigates the concept of self-supervised learning in neural networks, specifically by leveraging autoencoders for feature extraction. The primary goal is to analyze whether features learned by an unsupervised autoencoder, when augmented with a standard supervised network's input, can improve overall classification performance. The project systematically explores this idea by comparing the performance of a standard neural network against one augmented with autoencoder features, across different model capacities.

#### **2. Technologies Used**

* **Python:** Programming language
* **NumPy:** Numerical operations
* **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks and autoencoders.
* **Matplotlib:** Data visualization for plotting performance curves.

#### **3. Key Contributions & Actions**

* **Autoencoder Implementation:** Designed and implemented a basic autoencoder architecture capable of learning meaningful representations from unsupervised data.
    * Trained the autoencoder on the dataset to reconstruct inputs, forcing it to learn compressed, useful features in its bottleneck layer.
* **Feature Extraction:** Developed a method to extract the learned latent features from the trained autoencoder.
* **Augmented Network Architecture:** Created an augmented neural network architecture that concatenates the original input features with the autoencoder-learned features.
* **Standard Network Implementation:** Implemented a baseline standard neural network for supervised learning.
* **Performance Comparison Across Model Capacities:**
    * Trained both the standard network and the augmented self-supervised network across various model capacities (e.g., varying number of hidden units or layers).
    * Compared the classification accuracy of the two network types at each capacity level.
* **Analysis of Autoencoder Feature Impact:** Evaluated how adding autoencoder features influenced the performance of the supervised network, particularly noting scenarios where improvement or degradation occurred.
    * Identified that augmented networks *can* improve performance, especially when the supervised model itself is small or underfitting.
    * Observed that with larger, sufficiently capable supervised networks, the benefit of autoencoder features might diminish or even negatively impact performance.

#### **4. Results & Insights**

* The project successfully demonstrated the process of self-supervised learning using autoencoders and integrating learned features into a supervised task.
* Results indicated that self-taught learning (using autoencoder features) is most beneficial when the primary supervised model has limited capacity or is prone to underfitting. In such cases, the rich, unsupervised features from the autoencoder can provide valuable additional information, improving generalization.
* Conversely, for larger or already well-performing supervised networks, the inclusion of autoencoder features did not consistently yield significant improvements and, in some configurations, even slightly decreased performance. This suggests that highly capable supervised models might already capture sufficient features or that concatenating autoencoder features might introduce redundancy or noise if not carefully managed.
* This project provided critical insights into the practical application and limitations of self-supervised learning, emphasizing the importance of considering both the supervised model's capacity and the quality of unsupervised features when designing a self-taught learning pipeline.
