### Applied Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects completed as part of my machine learning coursework. Each project demonstrates a fundamental concept or algorithm in machine learning, ranging from classical methods to modern deep learning techniques, implemented primarily in Python. These projects highlight my ability to:

  * **Implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch**
  * **Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems**
  * **Conduct model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis**
  * **Understand and analyze bias-variance trade-offs**
  * **Utilize popular machine learning libraries and frameworks**
